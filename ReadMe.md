# IRON YARD INDEX
*An index of Iron Yard repositories*

The following repos were created during the 12-week front-end engineering bootcamp at The Iron Yard.  They contain various homework assignments and extremely high-paced-output apps.  Some are proof of grasping of just the core concept, others are in-depth exact replications of given templates or images in order to understand the implementation of certain apps.
